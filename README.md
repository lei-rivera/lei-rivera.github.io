# Lei Rivera - Web Developer

This is my portfolio site that shows that projects and skills. Right now I am using an HTML5Up template to showcase my work to any potential freelance clients, but I am in the process of rebuilding the website using my own design and code.

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://lei-rivera.github.io/

## How It's Made

I used the template "Read Only" from HTML5Up.net, then edited some design elements like pictures and colors to match my brand aesthetic (aka ✨ purple ✨)

I am in the process of rebuilding the website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The form is connected through Web3Forms.
